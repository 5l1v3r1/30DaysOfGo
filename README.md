I decided a while back to learn the Go programming language. For me to learn a new language I need a project and a deadline. Early in March of 2017 I had the idea to release a new Go script every day of April and I decided to name the project 30 Days of Go.
For the next 30 days, I will release a new Go script to this repo. The first few scripts are designed to teach some basic concepts in Go and the remaining scripts put those concepts into action. Some of the scripts are simple and fun, while others are designed to be the foundation for nice infosec tools.

* Day 1 - strings.go
