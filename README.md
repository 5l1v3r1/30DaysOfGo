# 30 Days of Go
A while back, I decided to learn the Go programming language but for me to learn a new language I need a project and a deadline. Early in March of 2017 I had the idea of releasing a new Go script every day of April and I decided to name the project 30 Days of Go.

For the next 30 days, I will be releasing a new Go script to this repo. The first few scripts are designed to teach some basic concepts in Go and the remaining scripts put those concepts into action. Some of the scripts are simple and fun, while others are designed to be the foundation for nice infosec tools.

Please, take these scripts, build on them, and tell me about it. If any of the scripts do not work as expected please open an issue and provide details about the problem you are having. If you want more detailed explanations of what the scripts are doing feel free to DM me on Twitter @averagesecguy or send me an email stephen at averagesecurityguy.info.

* Day 1 - strings.go
* Day 2 - flow.go
* Day 3 - functions.go

* Day 6 - encode.go
* Day 7 - decode.go
* Day 8 - hash.go
* Day 9 - sieve.go
* Day 10 - isprime.go
* Day 11 - factor.go  (Read this https://thenewstack.io/understanding-golang-packages/ and see if you can make a module to consolidate the code for days 9 - 11.)
* Day 12 - iterhash.go
* Day 13 - krypt.go
* Day 14 - insert_encoder.go  (Use the flag package discussed in this script to try to join the encode and decode scripts.)
